# Trade Wire

**Trade Wire** is an open-source inquiry and trade administration system built in Go, React, Redux.

## How to run it on your machine

Prequisites:
- Golang
- NodeJS
- Postgresql
- [Realize](https://github.com/tockins/realize) (optional)

*I like to use Realize because it watches for file changes and rebuilds*

run from root directory:
```
realize run
```
